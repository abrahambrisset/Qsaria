# Molecular Design

Use this skill when the user wants small-molecule analogs, scaffold variants, or candidate generation from a seed molecule or current dataset.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the task is small-molecule design, not peptide design.
2. Resolve the seed compound from the user prompt or session memory.
3. Inspect available engines with `mol_list_design_engines`.
4. In default MCP, use `engine="autoencoder"` for generation. `engine="llm"` is unavailable because `MCPAgentContext.model` is `None` unless trusted `agno_team_run` delegation is explicitly enabled.
5. Generate candidates with `mol_design_molecules`, `mol_generate_analogs`, or `mol_interpolate_molecules` as appropriate.
6. Validate generated or user-provided structures with `mol_validate_design_candidates` before presenting structures as final.
7. Rank validated candidates with `mol_rank_design_candidates`, using seed similarity when a seed SMILES is available.
8. Persist final candidates with `mol_register_design_candidates` and keep large candidate lists in artifacts rather than chat text.
9. Use `session_materialize_candidate_set_dataset` before GTM projection or batch retrosynthesis. Use `gtm_project_data` only after a suitable GTM map exists.

## Expected Outputs

- Registered candidate set.
- Candidate artifact with full generated/validated structures.
- Optional CSV materialization for projection, reporting, or synthesis planning.
- Validation and ranking summary.
