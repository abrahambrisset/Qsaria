"""Registry mapping cs_copilot prompt constants to MCP prompts.

Each entry exposes one of the curated agent / team instruction lists in
``src/cs_copilot/agents/prompts.py`` (pure string content, no Agno team
imports) plus the two ChEMBL LLM-as-judge prompt templates so that an
external reasoner can recreate the in-process filtering itself.
